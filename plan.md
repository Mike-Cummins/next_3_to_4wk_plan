# My 3-4 Week Plan
==============================

1. Practice. __PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!__ Then practice some more. I am starting my morning with 1hr (*at least*) of coding each day while I finish my coffee. I have alumni and current Turing students in my support circle that are getting me setup with resources to stay fresh and learn additional Ruby skills during the break.

1. Be diligent with my calendar - _that means actually using it_ - and adjusting it each day to accurately track my time.

1. Get outside! I'm about to spend a whole lot more time inside and in front of my computer...time to get as much fresh air as I can hiking, camping, biking, and paddling.

3. Visit family. I am scheduling visits this month with all of my family that lives out of the area that I most likely won't be able to visit until after I graduate and getting some good quality with my wife in while I can.

4.  Network. I have already started building my network within Turing students and alumni, but I would like to continue getting to know and work with my cohort mates prior to starting Mod 1.
